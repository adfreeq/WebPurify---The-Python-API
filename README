The WebPurify Profanity Filter Web Service consists of several callable methods. To perform an action using the WebPurify Web Service, you need to send a request to its endpoint specifying a method and some arguments using the REST calling convention. You will then receive a formatted response.

The REQUIRED parameter method is used to specify the calling method. Currently WebPurify offers 6 methods:
    webpurify.live.check
    webpurify.live.checkcount
    webpurify.live.replace
    webpurify.live.return
    webpurify.live.addtoblacklist
    webpurify.live.addtowhitelist
The REQUIRED parameter api_key is used to authenticate your request. If you don't have a license key you can purchase one.

The REQUIRED parameter text is the string you would like to check for profanity.

The arguments, responses and error codes for each method are listed on each spec page for each method.
